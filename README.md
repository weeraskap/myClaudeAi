Please help me create a README.md for my Python CLI tool called "LogAnalyzer". It's a command-line utility that analyzes log files for security incidents and generates detailed reports.

Key features include:
- Real-time log monitoring
- Pattern matching with regex
- Automated report generation
- Support for multiple log formats
- Export to CSV/JSON
```
